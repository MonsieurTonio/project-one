# Project-One

First project as part of Ironhack bootcamp.
Game based browser project.

## GAME IDEA

For my project I created a game based off a game (Dance Dance Revolution) that I played growing up. The idea of the game was simple. when the arrow appears on the screen, you have to move your feet to hit the correct arrow on the floor, as the game goes on, it gets harder by increasing the speed and having to get two arrows at the same time.
I decided to use this idea and put it into code. The arrows would appear on the screen from the right and you have to match the arrow when it appears within the box. For each level, the arrows get faster, there are more of them, and you have to reach a higher score.

DAY #1

- Created the layout and added the canvas for the movement of the arrows.
- Planned how I wanted the game to look and what functions were a priority.
- Created arrows as a function to make it easier to add more arrows later .

DAY #2

- Created the 'collision' function and added multiple arrows.
- Enabled the keydown function to detect when arrow is in the box.
- Logged the score in the console to make sure it worked.

DAY #3

- Added more arrows.
- Added the score to the DOM.
- Added a game over function for when the player has no lives left.

DAY #4

- Replay function added which takes users to the opening page.
- Added a win function when the user reached a certain score.
- Game over function added for when users don't get to the target score before the arrows run out.
- sound added while the arrows are moving. Sounds stops when the user wins or loses.

DAY #5

- Background image added.
- Alterted the layout in prepration for the final presentation.
- Level 2 added

## CHALLENGES

- getting the arrows to move individually. Orginally when adding multiple arrows they all appeared at the same time on top of each other.
- Getting the game to stop/have a win function. I wanted the game to stop after all the arrows had been

## THINGS TO CHANGE

- readd level two
