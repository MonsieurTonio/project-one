Created the layout and added the canvas for the movement of the arrows. 
Planned how I wanted the game to look and what functions were a priority. 
Created arrows as a function to make it easier to add more arrows later .

Enabled the keydown function to detect when arrow is in the box. 
Logged the score in the console to make sure it worked.

Added the score to the DOM. 
Added a game over function for when the player has no lives left.


DAY #4
Replay function added which takes users to the opening page.
